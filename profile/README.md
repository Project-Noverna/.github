# Noverna

**Redefining the future of FiveM development - secure, transparent, and built to last.**

Noverna is a collective of developers focused on rebuilding the foundation of FiveM scripting.  
We’re creating a framework that eliminates unsafe practices, backdoors, and performance issues - replacing them with stability, openness, and modern engineering standards.

## Our Mission

For too long, the FiveM community has relied on scripts that are unsafe, poorly written, and often closed off from real transparency.  
Noverna’s mission is simple: **to make FiveM development secure again** - for developers, servers, and players alike.

We believe that true progress comes from **clean code, open collaboration, and uncompromising quality**.

---

## Core Principles

- **Security first** - zero tolerance for backdoors, leaks, or obfuscation.  
- **Transparency by design** - every line of code is public, auditable, and open for review.  
- **Performance and reliability** - built with efficiency and long-term stability in mind.  
- **Freedom for developers** - modular APIs, clean architecture, and modern tooling.

## What We’re Building

Noverna is developing a next-generation framework for FiveM, featuring:

- A modular and secure core  
- Sandboxed runtime for isolated resource execution  
- We mainly going to use TypeScript, as main language. 
- Built-in dependency and lifecycle management  
- A focus on developer experience, maintainability, and scalability  

This isn’t just another framework - it’s a **foundation for the next era** of FiveM development.
